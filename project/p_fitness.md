### Human Motion Analysis for Automatic Feedback


![](mp_fitness.jpg)

The purpose of this project is to analyse human motion and use it to give feedback for fitness performance. While there is a reference [paper](https://fit3d.imar.ro/sites/default/files/public/pdf/Fieraru_2021_CVPR.pdf), we want you to focus on a subtask of your choice based on the provided [Fit3D Dataset](https://fit3d.imar.ro/challenges). Possible Sub-Tasks include, but are not limited to:
- 3D Pose Reconstruction from 2D input
- Counting the number of repetitions of one exercise
- activity recognition
- comparison of performed vs. instructed exercises

#### Main goals
- Select one (sub-)task and consider what you need to solve it. Are other subtasks part of it?
- Search for other datasets, code, and publications according to your task of choice. 
- Research into the literature on how others approach this task, i.e. which methods do they use to solve the problem?
- Develop appropriate representations and goal definitions, so carefully check: which metrics are used to assess the quality of the results?
- You can use existing solutions to test and evaluate them on the suggested dataset (or another one of your choice).

#### Optional goals
- Think towards real-world applications for activity recognition and prediction. Could your approach be used to build a training assistant for automated feedback?
